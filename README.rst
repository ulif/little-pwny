Check whether a password has been compromised

Query the `have-i-been-pwned database <https://haveibeenpwned.com>`_ for breaches
that contain a given password. Returns the number of breaches found in the
database:

    $ pwny p@ssw0rd
    51763

    $ pwny aiPh1eehec8AhY2y
    0

At no time the raw password is transferred to https://haveibeenpwned.com.
Instead we use the generoulsy offered API to deploy
`k-anonymity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity>`_. I.e. we send the
first five chars of the SHA1 hash of any given password. This way you can check
new passwords without revealing them to the server (or any listening party).

Install
=======

with `pip` and possibly `virtualenv`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create and activate a virtualenv:

     $ virtualenv env
     $ source ./env/bin/activate.sh

Then, from this directory, install the package:

     $ pip install -e .


## Running Tests

We use `tox` and `py.test` for testing. So,

     $ pip install tox
     $ tox

should run all tests.
