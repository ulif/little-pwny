***********

Check whether a password has been compromised

|bdg-build| \| |pypi-release|


Query the `have-i-been-pwned database <https://haveibeenpwned.com>`_ for breaches
that contain a given password. Returns the number of breaches found in the
database::

    $ pwny p@ssw0rd
    51763

    $ pwny aiPh1eehec8AhY2y
    0

Please note, that the executable script is called `pwny`.

At no time the raw password is transferred to https://haveibeenpwned.com.
Instead we use the generously offered haveibeenpwned.com-API to deploy
`k-anonymity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity>`_. I.e. we send the
first five chars of the SHA1 hash of any given password. This way you can check
new passwords without revealing them to the server (or any listening party).

`little-pwny` requires no additional packages. It requires Python 3.x.
